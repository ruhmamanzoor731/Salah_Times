🕌 Salah Time Calculator System
📌 Project Description

The Salah Time Calculator System is a full-stack web application designed to provide accurate daily prayer (Salah) timings based on selected cities. The system allows users to view prayer times through a responsive and user-friendly interface, while an admin panel manages cities and prayer schedules.

The frontend of the application is developed using React, ensuring a modern, interactive, and responsive user experience. The backend is built using Node.js, which handles API requests, business logic, and communication with the database. SQL is used as the database to store city information and corresponding Salah times in a structured and reliable manner.

This project demonstrates the practical implementation of full-stack development concepts, including frontend–backend integration, RESTful APIs, and database management.
